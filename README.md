# Ynov Nantes PWA Live coding sessions

## Content

In this repository, you will find the final code of the live-coding sessions that happened during class, organised by session number.

The PDFs of the courses are not public and can be found on your Ynov Teams file storage, in the Mobile Web channel.

## Naming convention:
 - `Session1-2` designates the two sessions on the first day
 - `Session3-4` designates the two sessions on the second day
 - and so on.
